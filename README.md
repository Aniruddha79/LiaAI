LiaAI is nothing but a simple yet advance beginner's project.
The project is launched using ```python3 app.py``` and should be launched in a virtual environment(venv). It is a very vital thing to launch the program in a venv or else it won't work.

After activating a venv, type ``` pip install cohere``` to get the package files installed in your venv.

After doing so, you can finally start the program.
*Note: This is just the alpha stage of this project. It is not even properly patched. So, don't get your hopes too high.*

peace...!
